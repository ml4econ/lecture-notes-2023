# Some (Sobering) Facts

["Eight Things to Know about Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00612) by Sam Bowman (2023):

.pull-left[
- LLMs predictably get more capable with increasing investment, even without targeted innovation.

- Many important LLM behaviors emerge unpredictably as a byproduct of increasing investment.

- LLMs often appear to learn and use representations of the outside world.

- There are no reliable techniques for steering the behavior of LLMs.
]
.pull-right[
- Experts are not yet able to interpret the inner workings of LLMs.

- Human performance on a task isn't an upper bound on LLM performance.

- LLMs need not express the values of their creators nor the values encoded in web text.

- Brief interactions with LLMs are often misleading.

# Accessing GPT-4

.pull-left[
First, create an OpenAI account.

- Option 1: Access via [ChatGPT *Plus*](https://chat.openai.com/)
- Option 2: Try the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)
- Option 3: Use the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Option 4: Explore through [Bing](https://www.bing.com/)

*Important*: GPT-3.5 and Bing offer free access. ChatGPT with GPT-4 costs $20 per month. To reduce costs, consider using the API. 

[Google's Bard](https://bard.google.com/) provides a free alternative (not GPT-4).

# Principle 1: Write Clear Instructions

.pull-left[
ChatGPT can't read your mind: specify your needs clearly. If outputs are too long, ask for brief replies; if too simple, ask for expert-level writing. Also, specify the format you desire.

### Tactics:
- __Provide detailed queries__
- Request model to adopt a persona
- Use delimiters for distinct input parts
- Specify required steps
- Provide examples
- Indicate desired output length

# Principle 2: Provide Reference Text

# Tip: Extracting Text and Equations from Documents

# Principle 3: Split Complex Tasks into Simpler Subtasks

.pull-left[

# Tip: Reduce Hallucinations Thorough Preparation

1. Initially, search for relevant information.
2. Subsequently, formulate the answer based on this information.

Example prompt:


>`step 1: Revisit and thoroughly read the policy memo.`

>`step 2: Conduct research to find academic papers that are relevant to the subjects discussed in the memo.`

>`step 3: Update the memo by incorporating references to support the assertions made within it.`

>`step 4: Compile a bibliography of these references and add it to the memo.`

# Tip: Request Structured Output 

Requesting structured output enhances stability and allows for the replication of your results.

```


---
# Principle 4: Give GPTs Time to "Think"

.pull-left[
GPTs make more reasoning errors when rushed. Requesting reasoning before an answer improves reliability.

### Tactics:
- Ask model to work out solutions before concluding
- Use a sequence of queries or inner monologue to guide reasoning process
- __Ask the model to review its previous answers__

# Proofreading and Editing

>`As an AI copy editor, your primary responsibility is to proofread a text enclosed by triple quotes and ensure it is clear and flows smoothly. Your task also includes avoiding passive voice, emphasizing essential concepts using boldface and italics, keeping sentences short and suitable for a presentation, and using bullets wherever possible. Additionally, you must verify that the title accurately conveys the text's message and, if necessary, change it to reflect the content. To deliver your output, you must present it in a Markdown code box. Once you have completed your proofreading task, request additional editing tasks if necessary.`

# Coding

ChatGPT can perform the following coding tasks:

- **Generation** (and soon code execution): It can generate code, such as writing an R function that sorts a vector in descending order.

- **Debugging**: Simply copying and pasting error messages allows ChatGPT to assist with code debugging.

- **Annotation**: You can ask ChatGPT to explain what a particular piece of code is doing.

- **Translation**: ChatGPT is capable of translating code, for example, from Python to R and vice versa.
